# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Anaylsis
# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to identify distinct customer segments using clustering algorithms. By analyzing customer data, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer service, and develop personalized products, leading to increased customer satisfaction and retention.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers).

**Features:**
- `CustomerID`: Unique ID assigned to each customer
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data Collection and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Clustering Algorithms (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL for data extraction (not covered in this code, assuming the data is already extracted and available as a CSV file)
- Python for analysis

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset (e.g., `Mall_Customers.csv`)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with code for data analysis and clustering
- `images/`: Images and visualizations generated during the analysis
- `README.md`: Project documentation
